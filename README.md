# Soybean-Seed-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains code and datasets for a thesis on soybean seed image classification using deep learning. It compares the performance of YOLOv8 and ResNet-50 in classifying five seed types: broken, intact, spotted, immature, and skin-damaged, while also evaluating the impact of color augmentation on model accuracy.
